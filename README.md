### 4. Building the APK
- To run the finished app on your own device, we need to build an APK file.
- Go to Build > Build App Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
- This will build the app in debug mode. Wait for the app to finish building.
- To build the app in release mode, go to Build > Select Build Variant and select "Release"
- This will require you to sign the APK before running Build. Go to Build > Generate Signed APK / Bundle and follow the instructions to sign the APK.
